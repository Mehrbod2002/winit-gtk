# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

Please keep one empty line before and after all headers. (This is required for `git` to produce a conflict when a release is made while a PR is open and the PR's changelog entry would go into the wrong section).

And please only add new entries to the top of this list, right below the `# Unreleased` header.
